              <strong>Dr. Denise Ferreira</strong>, the founder and CEO of FEM Calcul, obtained her MSc in Structural
              Engineering from University of Porto, Portugal (2009) and her <strong>PhD</strong> from Polytechnic
              University of Catalonia, Barcelona (2013). She worked as a university lecturer and academic researcher
              being involved in several projects focused on the analysis of concrete structures, covering both numerical
              and experimental fields. She has worked as a researcher in <strong>Universidade do Porto</strong>,
              Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC) and TU Delft.
