                <strong>Dr. Denise Ferreira</strong>, the founder and CEO of FEM Calcul, obtained her MSc in Structural
                Engineering from University of Porto, Portugal (2009) and her <strong>PhD</strong> from Polytechnic
                University of Catalonia, Barcelona (2013). She worked as a university lecturer and academic researcher
                being involved in several projects focused on the analysis of concrete structures, covering both
                numerical and experimental fields. She has worked as a researcher in{' '}
                <strong>Universidade do Porto</strong>, Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC) and TU Delft.
